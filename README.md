A powerful and intuitive GUI sidebar for executing Django's `manage.py` commands directly within Visual Studio Code. Stop typing, start clicking!

## Why Django GUI?

Manually typing `python manage.py <command>` and its various arguments is repetitive and error-prone. Django GUI provides a beautiful, organized, and discoverable interface for all your Django commands, seamlessly integrated into the VS Code Activity Bar.

This extension is perfect for both beginners who are learning the commands and for experienced developers who want to speed up their workflow.

## Features

* **✨ Full Command Palette:** Access all standard Django commands like `runserver`, `makemigrations`, `migrate`, `collectstatic`, and more.
* **🎨 Organized & Themed UI:** Commands are grouped by category (Project, Database, Users) with unique, colored icons that look great in any theme.
* **⚙️ Interactive Options:** Interactively set command arguments and flags using native VS Code input boxes, dropdowns, and checkboxes.
* **🧠 Smart Terminal Management:**
    * **Dedicated Terminals** for continuous commands like `runserver` and `shell`. Rerunning the command automatically stops the old process and starts a new one.
    * **Shared Terminal** for all single-execution commands, keeping your workspace clean.
* **🚀 One-Click Execution:** Run commands with a single click. No more context switching or manual typing.
* **💻 Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
